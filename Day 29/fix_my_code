# -----------------------generate_password function.-------------------- #

# My function is poorly written
# Used too many unnecessary logic that just make things become unclear

much better way to do this is using list comprehension
My approach:
    a bunch of craps, cant even understand what i wrote
Instructor approach:
    for everything that make output as a list, consider using list comprehension
    try to be obsess with list comprehension.
    To make it simple, her approach can be explain in two step:
    # Step 1:
        Use list comprehension to make three lists for each type of character
    # Step 2:
        Combine them together and use "shuffle()" function to rearrange them
        Then use join to turn it back to a string
    Just pure beauty

# ----------------------- check_missing_fields function ------------------ #

# Although this part is bad too, but i can blame it for not knowing about
message box class
# So ill try to read just some of it to fix.

# Read My code:
    What a relief, i didn't actually make bad code.
    Instead, i just too focused on making things to look nice
    But, still:
        Lines_waste_counter =
        3 : getting entry values twice
        5 : making error popup window which can be much shorter
        9999: make a bridge function with the only use is to check

# Her code:
    One line :D

# ------------------------ check save function --------------------------- #

# Not that bad, but, again, just look at Angela's code:
# Just,....
# I WANT TO WRITE CLEAN CODE

# I will just explain what she did:
    So easy to catch up that there are only three steps here:
    # Step 1:
        Get entries value
    # Step 2:
        Check if there are any field left unfilled if not go to Step 3
    # Step 3:
        Give final check for the information we input then write it to data file.
# Just pure beauty, again
