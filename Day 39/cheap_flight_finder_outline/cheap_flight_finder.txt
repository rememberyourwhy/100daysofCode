So each classes can get, find, update their responsible datas.
This main program will decide when for them to do it and how to do it in cooperate with others objects and methods

# First thing is checking weather or not we have iata code in IATA Code row.
# If no, we call iata search from Flight_Search class, then modify the respectful data in sheet_data
# Then update the data on sheety using update_data method in Data_Manager class

# STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION:
# Check if the first row iata codes is filled.
If not, it means that the first update for destination_data didn't start
So we will update destination_data by updating sheet_data which is a copy of destination_data
Then we will assign sheet_data back for destination_data and call update_destination_code method
# Also remember to import Flight_Search and make an object of it
