This file will responsible for talking to sheety
Means that if we want to get or put requests to sheety, we will create functions in this Data_Manager class to do it for us

# Basic functions of this class:
# get data function
# put data function


# STEP BY STEP EXPLANATION:
Function 1: init:
    declare self.destination_data which holds every info we requests.get from sheety
Function 2: get_destination_data:
    # Guess: use requests.get to get data from sheety endpoint
    # modify self.destination_data with the response information
    # also return self.destination_data
    Guess is right
Function 3: update_destination_codes:
    # update only destination_codes column, not all
    # iterate through the city:
    new_data = {
        "price": {
            "iataCode": city["iataCode"]
        }
    }
    url = f"{SHEETY_PRICES_ENDPOINT}/{city["id"]",
    json = new_data
    requests.put using that two arg
