parts that are the same:

UI setup

parts that are not important:
    data processing

# ---- IMPORTANT PART THAT ARE DIFF: ----- #
    - NEXT CARD FUNCTION
    - IS_KNOWN FUNCTION

# NEXT CARD FUNCTION:
Cancel window.after
Choose random card from the dict
Item_config for card_title, card_word, card_background
Continue window.after

# IS_KNOWN FUNCTION:
REMOVE current card from the data (to_learn)
TURN current data (to_learn) to DataFrame data (data)
SAVE it to csv file
CALL next_card() function


# Project summarise:
# New things: use records to change data from csv file to dataframe object to list of dictionary
# two good function written: next_card function and is_known function
# next_card function uses window.after, window.after_cancel and random.choice
    --:> to stop auto reveal cards after next_card is called
# is_known function uses remove to get rid of known card
# then turn the data back to csv and save it
# at the end, it calls next card function
# flip_card just change card_title, card_word, card_bg content and color
