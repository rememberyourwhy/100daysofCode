# from turtle import Turtle, Screen
# import random

# What will be different here
# I'll create some obstacle on the race to slow turtles down or boost them
# How to do it?
# Go through an x-axis and put obstacles and boosts on it. (step = 5)
# Save these coordinates to a list
# TC, SC

# Change the way the turtles move, so they can hit obstacles or boosts easier
# Move 5 or 10 each time


# Create screen object, change their setup(width, height)
# Create color list
# Create y_coordinate list
# Create turtle objects, store them inside a list
# Move them to their right position
# Make a bet
# If the bet is made
# Start the run inside a while loop
# Move each turtle in the list by random distance, 5 or 10
# Check if they run into an obstacle ( -5 distance ) or a boost ( +10 distance )
# Check if they finished the race and print result

# Todo: Check if you want to do this
