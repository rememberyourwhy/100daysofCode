The thing here is that i tried to do so many things as once

To be specific:
my count_down function is, just so bad to read
The original one dont even have to use that shortened time_str
So to get this easier to compare
I'll summarise what the count_down function does in the original program
Then ill compare it with what i did myself

first, format the timer string
then config it to the canvas

second, check count > 0 and continue the recursion
else:  # count returned to 00:00
    call its mother function, which is start_timer()
    then reset marks label

Wow, and that's just it
Just simple as that

And angela lefts so many rooms for me to improve code length also

Now, lets see what i did:
I don't even know how I came up with that
just a collection of garbage
